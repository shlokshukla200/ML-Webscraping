            "Machine learning algorithms are essentially sets of instructions that allow computers to learn from data, make predictions, and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms are broadly categorized into three types:\n",
            "Supervised learningalgos are trained on datasets where each example is paired with a target or response variable,known as the label.The goal is to learn a mapping function from input data to the corresponding output labels, enabling the model to make accurate predictions on unseen data. Supervised learning problems are generally categorized intotwo main types:ClassificationandRegression. Most widely used supervised learning algorithms are:\n",
            "Linear regressionis used to predict a continuous value by findingthe best-fit straight line between input (independent variable) and output (dependent variable)\n",
            "Logistic regressionpredicts probabilities and assigns data points to binary classes (e.g., spam or not spam).\n",
            "Note : Despite its name, logistic regression is used for classification tasks, not regression.\n",
            "Adecision treesplits data into branches based on feature values, creating a tree-like structure.\n",
            "For more decision tree algorithms, you can explore:\n",
            "SVMsfind the best boundary (called a hyperplane) that separates data points into different classes.\n",
            "KNNis a simple algorithm that predicts the output for a new data point based on the similarity (distance) to its nearest neighbors in the training dataset, used for both classification and regression tasks.\n",
            "Based onBayes' theoremand assumes all features are independent of each other (hence \"naive\")\n",
            "Random forestis an ensemble method that combinesmultiple decision trees.\n",
            "For in-depth understanding :What is Ensemble Learning?-Two types of ensemble methods in ML\n",
            "These algorithms build models sequentially, meaningeach new model corrects errors made by previous ones.Combines weak learners (like decision trees) to create a strong predictive model.Effective for both regression and classification tasks. :Gradient Boosting in ML\n",
            "For more ensemble learning and gradient boosting approaches, explore:\n",
            "Neural Networks, including Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), are considered part of supervised machine learning algorithmsas they require labeled data to train and learn the relationship between input and desired output;network learns to minimize the errorusingbackpropagation algorithmto adjust weights during training.\n",
            "For in-depth understanding :Supervised multi-layer perceptron model-What is perceptron?\n",
            "Unsupervised learning algosworks withunlabeled datato discover hidden patterns or structures without predefined outputs. These are again divided intothree main categoriesbased on their purpose:Clustering,Association Rule Mining, andDimensionality Reduction.First we'll see algorithms for Clustering, then dimensionality reduction and at last association.\n",
            "Clustering algorithms group data points into clusters based on their similarities or differences. The goal is to identify natural groupings in the data. Clustering algorithms are divided intomultiple types based on the methods they use to group data. These types includeCentroid-based methods,Distribution-based methods,Connectivity-based methods, andDensity-based methods. For resources and in-depth understanding, go through the links below.\n",
            "Dimensionality reductionis used to simplify datasets by reducing the number of features while retaining the most important information.\n",
            "Find patterns (called association rules) between items in large datasets, typically inmarket basket analysis(e.g., finding that people who buy bread often buy butter). It identifies patterns based solely on the frequency of item occurrences and co-occurrences in the dataset.\n",
            "Reinforcement learninginvolves training agents to make a sequence of decisions by rewarding them for good actions and penalizing them for bad ones. Broadly categorized intoModel-BasedandModel-Freemethods, these approaches differ in how they interact with the environment.\n",
            "These methods use a model of the environment to predict outcomes and help the agent plan actions by simulating potential results.\n",
            "These methods do not build or rely on an explicit model of the environment. Instead, the agent learns directly from experience by interacting with the environment and adjusting its actions based on feedback. Model-Free methods can be further divided intoValue-BasedandPolicy-Basedmethods:\n",
